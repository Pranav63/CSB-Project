# CSB-Project
Its a data_science Churn Prediction project with a highly imbalance target variable.

You will share a modelling data set over which you are to train your model.
A testing data set, over which you are to show your performance output as shown below. 
Basically a precision-recall curve. 

Unlike other modelling challenges, we are looking for a skill-set beyond just pure outputs. 
Share your work in the best way you deem it to be fit: Jupyter Notebook, Github repository etc. 

You will be evaluated over your ability to explain, model, creativity and write clear and clean code.
